This code performs stratified 10-fold Cross-validation (CV) and Stratified 10X10 nested-CV to evaluate optimized predictive models based on datasets derived from the TCGA-BRCA project (https://gdc.cancer.gov/).

To run the code examples, python version 3.7.3 is required, which can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/?fbclid=IwAR1VrxINLd7djn_4UuQTxshpya9D2wmt_H0jnUaJrEXVCoalD3viphyLRyI

Specific python libraries used in this study are listed below and can be installed using pythonâ€™s in-build pip module by executing the code directly from Linux terminal command line.

Pandas version 1.2.3

Scikit-learn version 0.20.1

Imbalanced-learn version 0.3.3

Dtreeviz version 1.2

Joblib version 1.0.1

Graphviz version 0.16

Matplotlib version 3.3.4

Numpy version 1.20.2

Seaborn version 0.11.1

Code example should be executed directly in the working directory from the Linux terminal command line

Usage: CART.py [-h] -i DATASET -c CLASSIFIER [-p HYPERPARAM] [-r NB_RANDOM_SEEDS] [-m METRIC] [-SW] [-log2] [-imp] [-t]

Optional arguments:

-h, --help : Show this help message and exit.

-i DATASET, --dataset: The tabulated pharmaco-omic dataset, where columns specify patients, their corresponding drug response (Responder or Non Responder), and molecular features for the selected profile.

-c CLASSIFIER, --classifier: supervised learning algorithm employed to build the classifiers. Possibilities here are: - CART or - PCART (CART with OMC).

-r NB_RANDOM_SEEDS, --random-seeds: Number of random seeds used to run cross-validation tests (Default = 5).

-m METRIC, --metric: Metric used to select optimized models (Default = MCC). Possibilities are: AUC, MCC, AUCPR, AVGPRE, PRE, REC, F1.

-sw, --sample-weighting: this option applies sample weighting.

-n, --normalize: this option normalizes the dataset prior to training and testing the classifier.

As an example, the following command line will carry out 5 10-fold cross-validation runs of a CART model using sample weight and data normalization on the isomiR dataset (provided in this repository):

$ CART_model.py -i BRCA_Doxorubicin_isomiR_RPM.tsv -c CART -r 5 -m MCC -sw -n
